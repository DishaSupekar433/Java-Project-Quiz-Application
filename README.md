The objective is to implement a simple quiz application in Java using GUI components
such as JFrame, JTextField, JTextArea, JButton, JLabel, and Timer. The quiz consists of ten
multiple-choice questions with four options each, and the user must select one of the options by
clicking on the corresponding button. The application also includes a timer that limits the time
available to answer each question and displays the final score of the user at the end of the quiz.
The code implements the ActionListener interface to handle the button click events and update
the UI components accordingly.
